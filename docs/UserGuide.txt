1. Wiring and Setup:

    The wiring is as follows for now:

    Pin 4: ChannelSelect[0]
    Pin 5: ChannelSelect[1]
    Pin 6: ChannelSelect[2]
    Pin 7: ChannelSelect[3]
    Pin 8: ChannelSelect[4]
    Pin 9: ChannelSelect[5]
    Pin 10: ChannelSelect[6]

    To connect to the board, use the application in the bin folder, it will connect to the Arduino
    assuming that it is using the default parameters for connection (it should)

    -- If there is an error message then you need to make sure the cables are fully plugged in 
    -- There is a driver that may need to be downloaded if it does not immediately connect
    -- Downloading Arduino IDE will auto install these drivers and allow for programming as well

    -- https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

2. How it Works

    - PC Side
        The program is very simple: it opens a serial port with the Arduino and sends the channel it wants to ChannelSelect
        over the serial port in the form of an integer string e.g. "16" for channel 16
    
    - Arduino Side
        The Arduino configures the GPIO pins corresponding to the channel select to be output pins and then waits for
        Serial data to come in. If it finds that it has been sent something, it sets the pins according to the channel 
        value sent by the PC

3. Modifying Software

    - PC Software
        The source code is written in Python and is in the src folder. Modifiable values that would be desirable to modify 
        are on the top of the file. Values such as sampling period, waveform width, etc

    - Arduino 
        Using the Arduino IDE, open the source file in the src folder titled main.ino and modify the values at the top 
        
4. Running the Software

    To run the software there is one dependency: Python: install that before you do anything:
    -- https://www.python.org/downloads/

    You can also find Python in the Windows store

    ::: Make Sure to Select "Add Python to PATH" during install :::

    Download and install the latest version and restart your computer 

    To run the software, on the first run you must run install.bat in the bin folder
    after the install is done you can either run SoundCath.bat or run SoundCath.py in src
    
    :: Do Not Disorder The Files or SoundCath.bat will not work ::

    The software will automatically probe for scopes and Arduinos and if there are no issues the 
    GUI will show up and you can run the app like normal
